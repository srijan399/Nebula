# Nebula - A Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform (DAO-style Fundraising)

## Overview: 
Nebula aims to create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where users can raise funds for their projects. Donors receive voting rights proportional to their contributions, allowing them to influence how funds are spent (Currently undergoing development).
The Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform aims to revolutionize the way projects are funded by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent and democratic system for raising and managing funds. Our platform allows individuals and organizations to launch fundraising campaigns for various projects, from social initiatives to innovative startups.

At the heart of this platform is the concept of decentralized governance. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms where the project creator has full control over the funds, our system empowers donors by granting them voting rights based on their contributions. This ensures that contributors have a direct say in how their funds are spent, fostering trust and accountability. (Still undergoing development)

Our project is particularly relevant in India, where many grassroots initiatives face challenges in securing funding and maintaining accountability. By providing a decentralized platform that prioritizes community involvement, we aim to empower local projects and drive positive change. 

Nebula happens to be our official submission for Based India 2024.
